This folder is used to track systemd migration.

When you install an updated package that contains a native systemd unit which
supersedes the legacy sysvinit script, the fact that the service is enabled or
not must be migrated to the systemd way of doing things.

This folder is simply a place to store a note of which services have been
migrated, such that the process is not repeated on subsequent package updates.
